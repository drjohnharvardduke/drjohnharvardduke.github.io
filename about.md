# Current Position:
# FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGIST

Owner of a Solo Private Practice; I function as an Expert Witness in matters involving the intersection of the Law and Clinical Psychology; I consult with members of the legal profession and others (**excluding Criminal Law cases & Family Court cases -such as Child Custody Evaluations**) in Civil Court actions (e.g., tort cases), Administrative Law, & Education Law (among others). My expertise lies in **Psychological Testing, Psychological Assessment, Psychological Evaluation, & Personality Functioning.** I provide verbal reports, written reports, and I testify in depositions and in front of judicial authorities. I have had extensive experience in Debate, Oratory, Original Oratory, and Acting. I have served for decades as a Professor explaining professional issues in clear and distinct language facilitating comprehension on the part of the layperson.

I would refer interested readers to the [following article](https://www.nytimes.com/1964/01/20/ruby-defense-based-on-a-mental-report.html). Reference is made here to the Psychological Testing conducted by Roy Schafer, Ph.D. of Jack Ruby who murdered Lee Harvey Oswald (the assassin of President John F. Kennedy).
 Dr. Schafer was retained by Melvin Belli, Esq. because of his expertise in Psychological Testing acquired at the Menninger Clinic under David Rapaport, Ph.D.
 **I was trained in this same tradition of using multiple psychological tests to assess an individual - it is the mind of the psychologist that is the ultimate sensitive psychological tool to understand another human being** (and the not the bare test results in and of themselves).
