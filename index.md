I am a Harvard trained **Clinical Psychologist** who provides services in the area of **Forensic Psychology** (the intersection of the Law and Psychology) in the Durham, Chapel Hill, and Raleigh area of North Carolina, USA.


I serve as an **Expert Witness** in many areas of law (with the exception of Criminal Law cases and Family Court cases, e.g. Child Custody cases).


My specialty lies in **Psychological Testing**. I received advanced training in this area during my Two-Year Post-Doctoral Training Program at the Menninger Clinic.
Only four Ph.D. level psychologists were chosen for this Post-Doctoral Fellowship from an applicant pool that was both national and international. The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN was founded in 1892 by a father and sons to excel in physical medicine. The Menninger Clinic was founded in 1919 in Topeka, KS by a father and sons to excel in mental and emotional health. Karl A. Menninger, M.D. hired David Rapaport, Ph.D. from Hungary to head up Psychological Testing. From this a famous tradition emerged wherein many psychologists were trained to become experts in Psychological Testing. I am one such alumnus.
